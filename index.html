<p><b>The Dreamweavers of West Tennessee is a volunteer, non-profit 501c3 community theater group located in a city owned, renovated movie theater on 601 Court St in historic downtown Savannah, Tennessee. Dreamweavers was founded in 1994, by M. I. Marshall, who conceived the idea, Jim Osburn, who willingly joined his fledgling Hardin County Harlequins with Dreamweavers, and Terry Marshall and Margaret Osburn, who provided the artistic and day to day support for the community theater. Over the past twenty three years Dreamweavers has presented more than hundred musicals, dramas and comedies. Dreamweavers presents several live theatrical works each year, including a major musical production in the summer. Membership is open and does not include any fees. Participate in any event, any way, and you are already a "MEMBER". Membership is automatically renewed if you participate in at least one event produced by Dreamweavers each year.</b></p>
