<p> Coming in 2018: The Little Mermaid JR</p>
<p> <img src= "http://www.drmwvrs.net/LITTLE%20MERMAID%20LOGO.jpg"> </p>
 <p> <b>Auditions in January. 
Open to grades 2-5.
  Show dates: March 2018.</b></p>
   <p> Please plan to come a little early in order to fill out your audition form and be sure to bring a parent/guardian with you as an adult must sign in order for you to audition. Everyone is expected to stay for the entire audition period, which may run for approximately two hours. Wear comfortable shoes and clothing and bring a bottle of water as we will be dancing! :)</p>
 
   <p>  Below is the list of the parts  open for The Little Mermaid.  Each character is listed with information about whether it is a solo singing role, if dancing is required and if the character has spoken lines. Pick a couple of characters you would like to be in the play and be ready to read some lines and learn a short dance for your audition when you get there.</p>
   <p>You may go to :
 Audition Central at:
https://www.mtishows.com/broadway-junior/audition-central?show_id=1449
     to view vocal ranges, lines for reading at audition, etc.</p>
   <p>If you are interested in a lead/solo role.
     We have included a link to the music from the show so that you can choose a short piece from the musical to sing for your audition: we will have the music from these youtube  files available at the auditions for those interested in a lead/solo role.</p>
